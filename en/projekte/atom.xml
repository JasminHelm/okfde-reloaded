The VBB released GTFS data, opened up their API and provided some geo datasets about entrances to stations. During the event, coders, software experts, and designers used open transport data to create applications intended to non-commercially improve public transport.</summary>

    <summary>Coding da Vinci is the first cultural data hackathon in Germany bringing together cultural heritage institutions and the hacker/designer community to develop ideas and prototypes for the cultural sector and the public. More and more galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) are digitalizing their collections to make them accessible online and to preserve our heritage for future generations. Only when cultural data is made openly available (according to the Open Definition) can it serve as the creative basis for innovative new applications and projects.</summary>

    <summary>DatenmachenSchule is a place where the potential of using open data in the classroom is illustrated. Based on the pioneering work of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, the Adolfinum Grammar School, the City of Moers and the Lower Rhine University of Applied Sciences OK-Lab, information and resources have been compiled that will enable teachers and schools to use applications based on open data. The OffenerHaushalt. de tool has been technically and structurally redesigned to visualize data on tax expenditure and thus make it clear and tangible.</summary>

    <summary>Energy data, environmental data, traffic data. More and more data is available to us today. We believe that the goal-oriented usage of relevant datasets could help nonprofit organizations to more effectively achieve their social objectives. However, only a few organizations have the required skills to work with data.
The Open Knowledge Foundation Germany has developed a data training program, covering everything from the finding, analyzing and visualizing of data to the design of data-driven campaigns.</summary>

    <summary>The &amp;ldquo;Demokratielabore&amp;rdquo; or Democracy Labs is a pilot project for adolescents between the age of 12 and 21. We aim to foster self-efficacy and empower young people by using technology for democracy. We strive to let children and young adults experience their own digital skills as a powerful tool to get involed in a democratic society as active and self-determined members. To reach that goal we organize workshops, establish working groups and run an online tv channel.</summary>

    <summary>Fiscal Transparency, Risk Assessment and Impact of Good Governance Policies Assessed.
The allocation of funds through public procurement (services, bulding contracts, and goods) represents a significant share of state expenditure. In the EU, this amounts to about 16% of the GDP. In many cases, the allocation of these contracts is not conducted transparently. As a result, 20-25% of the total number of orders can be lost to corruption.
In order to change this, we are working together with 5 partners on the EU project, DIGIWHIST.</summary>

    <summary>Energyhack is a hackathon around open energy data. Our energy supply and the ways of generation are manifold. But how is energy distributed and how do we ensure that more information is exchanged between producers&amp;rsquo; devices and consumers? Developers, designers, researchers and innovative thought leaders in the energy industry develop ideas, design hardware and prototypes or program new apps in 24 hours. The data from the Open Data Portal Netzdaten-Berlin was available to the participants as a database.</summary>
